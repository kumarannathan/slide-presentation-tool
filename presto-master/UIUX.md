In our application, Presto, we have implemented standard UI/UX principles, that make it simple and intuitive for new users to navigate through our site, as well as supplying a full range of services and applications for the slides. 

We have implemented fast feedback mechanisms for all the changes that are made to the slide (ex. font changes will change the font on the slide immediately) and the slide data will load right as a new slide is navigated to. 

We have consistent and simple design for our site, with backgrounds that are easy on the eyes and without clutter. Since the site is a creative one, the focus will be on the slides created, not the site itself. With a minimalist design, the user sees reduced distractions and only the essentials. 

The site is also responsive for all web sizes, but also for mobile and tablets. This ensures that the slides work will be just as navigatable no matter what device you are on. When the width of a site is made smaller, the navigation bar is also made to fold and collaspe. 

While creating a slideshow, all the features, such as adding images or video, creating text or code, are navigatable with easy to understand icons. 

In conclusion, with the various UI/UX principles implemented in Presto, a user will be enhanced experience using the application with its responsive design, feedback, and navigation.
